# Blueprint Gap Analysis — Built vs. Intended

You are performing a gap analysis: comparing what was actually built (implementation tracking, code, test results) against what was intended (blueprints, acceptance criteria). This identifies where blueprints, plans, or validation fell short and feeds into revision.

Dispatch a `surveyor` agent (via the Task tool) with the following instructions. If the Task tool is unavailable, execute the instructions directly.

## Agent Instructions for surveyor

### Phase 1: Read Blueprints (Intended)

1. Read `context/blueprints/blueprint-overview.md` to get the full domain map
2. For each domain, read `context/blueprints/blueprint-{domain}.md`
3. Catalog every requirement and its acceptance criteria into a checklist:
   - Requirement ID (R1, R2, etc.)
   - Requirement description
   - Each acceptance criterion
   - Source blueprint file

### Phase 2: Read Implementation (Built)

1. Read all impl tracking files in `context/impl/`
2. Read `context/plans/plan-build-site.md` for tier/progress state
3. Read `context/plans/plan-known-issues.md` for documented issues
4. Optionally run the test suite and capture results

### Phase 3: Compare

For each blueprint requirement and acceptance criterion, classify it:

| Status | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| **COMPLETE** | Acceptance criteria met, tests pass, code exists |
| **PARTIAL** | Some criteria met, others missing or failing |
| **MISSING** | Not implemented at all |
| **OVER-BUILT** | Implementation goes beyond what the blueprint requires (scope creep) |
| **UNTESTABLE** | Acceptance criteria cannot be automatically validated |

### Phase 4: Identify Revision Targets

For each gap (PARTIAL, MISSING, OVER-BUILT, UNTESTABLE), determine the root cause:

| Root Cause | Description | Fix Target |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Blueprint gap** | Requirement was ambiguous or missing detail | Update blueprint |
| **Plan gap** | Blueprint was clear but plan didn't cover it | Update plan |
| **Implementation gap** | Plan covered it but implementation is incomplete | Continue implementing |
| **Validation gap** | Built but no test verifies it | Add tests |
| **Scope creep** | Built without a blueprint requirement | Either add blueprint or remove code |

### Phase 5: Generate Report

```markdown
## Gap Analysis Report

### Summary
| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| COMPLETE | {n} | {%} |
| PARTIAL | {n} | {%} |
| MISSING | {n} | {%} |
| OVER-BUILT | {n} | {%} |
| UNTESTABLE | {n} | {%} |

### Overall Coverage: {complete + partial} / {total requirements}

### Detailed Findings

#### Complete
| Requirement | Blueprint | Evidence |
|------------|------|----------|
| R1: {name} | blueprint-{domain}.md | {test file or impl reference} |

#### Partial
| Requirement | Blueprint | Met | Missing | Root Cause |
|------------|------|-----|---------|-----------|
| R2: {name} | blueprint-{domain}.md | {criteria met} | {criteria missing} | {blueprint/plan/impl/validation gap} |

#### Missing
| Requirement | Blueprint | Root Cause | Suggested Action |
|------------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| R3: {name} | blueprint-{domain}.md | {root cause} | {action} |

#### Over-Built
| Feature | Files | Blueprint Coverage | Suggested Action |
|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| {feature} | {files} | No blueprint | Add blueprint or remove |

#### Untestable
| Requirement | Blueprint | Why Untestable | Suggested Action |
|------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| R4: {name} | blueprint-{domain}.md | {reason} | {rewrite criteria / add human review gate} |

### Revision Targets
| Priority | Target File | Change Needed | Affected Requirements |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| P0 | blueprint-{domain}.md | {what to update} | R{n}, R{n} |
| P1 | plan-{domain}.md | {what to update} | R{n} |

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Run `/blueprint:revise` to trace gaps into context files
2. {Specific blueprint updates needed}
3. {Specific plan updates needed}
4. {Implementation work remaining}
