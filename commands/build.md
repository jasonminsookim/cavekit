# Blueprint Build — Run the Implementation Loop

This is the third phase of Blueprint. Execute the setup script:

```!
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-build.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

## IMPORTANT: Switch to worktree

The setup script creates a git worktree for isolation. Look for the `BLUEPRINT_WORKTREE_PATH=` line in the output. If present, you MUST `cd` into that path before doing any work:

```
cd <BLUEPRINT_WORKTREE_PATH value>
```

If no `BLUEPRINT_WORKTREE_PATH` line appears, you're already in a worktree — stay where you are.

## How This Works

1. Creates a git worktree for isolated execution
2. Archives any previous loop cycle automatically
3. Reads the build site to find unblocked tasks
4. Each iteration: pick task → read blueprint → implement → validate → commit
5. With `--peer-review`: alternates build iterations with Codex (GPT-5.4) review
6. Exits when all tasks are done

You are now in a Ralph Loop implementing the build site. Follow the prompt instructions exactly.

## Critical Rules

- NEVER output the completion promise unless ALL tasks are genuinely DONE
- ONE task per iteration — stay focused
- If stuck 2+ iterations, document as dead end and move on
- Always run validation gates before committing
